    Hi {{vm.buyer.contact.firstname}},
    <br><br>
    Great to see you’ve been ordering from thortful :)
    <br><br>
    I’m just emailing as we’ve spotted that you’ve opted to send a card to someone else, {{vm.order.delivery_address.recipient}}, but it has no message inside! Was this your intention? 
    <br><br>
    It might be that you wanted to send it with a spare envelope, which we can include if you’d like, or alternatively if you want to add a message you can re-order and include this, then we can cancel and refund the original order.
    <br><br>
    Please let us know before {{(vm.dispatchDay==vm.today&&vm.changeTime)?'5:00pm':'4:30pm'}}, otherwise we’ll just assume that this is how you intended it to be, and send the card direct in a sealed envelope, without a message :)
    <br><br>
    Thanks,<br>
    {{vm.root.admin.contact.firstname}}
