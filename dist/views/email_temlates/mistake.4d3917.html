    Hi {{vm.buyer.contact.firstname}},
    <br>
    <br>
    Thanks for your email and I’m so sorry to hear that there is an issue with your card!
    <br>
    <br>    
    All of our cards are uploaded by talented creators from around the world - we carefully moderate each card uploaded to thortful to ensure they are up to standard for our customers, but somehow this one seems to have slipped through the net! Thanks so much for bringing this to our attention; I have removed the card from our catalogue and contacted the creator requesting that they update the artwork.
    <br>
    <br>    
    As soon as the creator updates the design, we can get this re-sent to you, or alternatively we can give you one free card credit on your account; you’ll just need to remember to apply this by ticking the box on checkout next time :)
    <br>
    <br>    
    Do let us know how you’d like to proceed and we’ll be happy to get this sorted for you!
    <br>
    <br>
    Thanks,
    <br>
    {{vm.root.admin.contact.firstname}}
